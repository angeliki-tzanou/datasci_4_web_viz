## Shiny/R:
- Challenge:
  - My app.R would not deploy through the posit cloud
    - Tried to troubleshoot and the error was regarding loading the dataset
    - When doing so I imported the csv file I had previously downloaded from the CDC database
    - Then I set the csv dataset as a working directory and altered the code by substituting the url reading portion with ``` df <- reactive({
    read.csv("__name_of_file__")
  })```

## Shiny/Python:
- Challenge:
  - My app would not get deployed in shinyapps.io
  - After running the necessary commands on the Google Shell terminal the app would show up on the dashboard as "undeployed"
  - Went to the log tab within the app in my shinyapps.io and troubleshooted through the error messages appearing there
    - Detected that there was an issue with the packages installed
    - Attempted to install the appropriate versions- but it still did not fix the issue
    - I had created my ```requirements.txt``` file through the ```pip freeze> requirements.txt``` command and realized that the versions that were included had some sort of conflict
    - So resolved the issue by going back and deleting the autogenerated packages under that file and manually wrote the ones that were needed to run my app.
    - Redeployed the app and showed up appropriately in my shiny dashboard.
